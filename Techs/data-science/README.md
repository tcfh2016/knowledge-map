## Data flow in data science process

- Raw data collection
  - Define purpose of data collection
  - Ask right questions and define business problem
  - Understand the domain
  - Establish process for data collection
  - Define rules that will support this process
  - Regularly check its execution
- Data parsing
  - Typically collected data is unstructured (web pages, emails, documents, PDFs), understand documents
  - Define extract rules
- Data preparation
  - Exploration, reduction, corruption detection, reconstruction, validation
  - Deploy various sanity check rules in data flow process
- Integration and transformation
  - Data stored in source dependent databases need to be combined
  - By using cloudified ELT approach (extract, load, transform)
- Data models and algorithms
  - Utilize data science by finding hidden patterns and unobvious insights
  - Select analytical techniques
  - Build models, validate model and analyze model result and make conclusions  
- Visualization and reporting
  - Interpret and summarize model results for story communication to others
- Decision
